  <h1>Terms and Conditions of Use</h1>
  <p>The guidelines governing the use of our platform, ensuring you have a smooth and secure experience while planning your bus journeys.</p>

  <h2>Article 1: Purpose</h2>
  <p>These Terms and Conditions of Use define the contractual relationship between the Data Controller and any individual or legal entity wishing to make a bus transport reservation via the Site, followed or not by the purchase of a transport ticket (hereinafter referred to as the "User").<br>
  The User acknowledges that validating a reservation through the Site constitutes unconditional acceptance of these Terms and Conditions of Use, confirms full understanding of them, and waives the right to rely on any conflicting personal conditions of purchase.<br>
  Before making a reservation, the User declares having full legal capacity to commit under these Terms and Conditions of Use and acknowledges that the reservation and purchase are strictly for personal use.</p>

  <p>To comply with any new regulations or to improve the use of the Site, the Data Controller reserves the right to modify the Terms and Conditions of Use at any time, at its sole discretion. Any modifications will apply to Users and Carriers from the date of reservation validation, without requiring further formalities.</p>

  <h2>Article 2: Transport Offers</h2>
  <p>The transport offers available on the Site correspond to bus journeys described on the platform and are subject to seat availability. Transport Providers may update or modify offers at any time, with the applicable price being the one in effect at the time of booking confirmation.</p>

  <h2>Article 3: Transport Prices</h2>
  <p>The transport prices displayed on the Site are indicated in Moroccan Dirhams (MAD), inclusive of all taxes, including VAT applicable on the booking date. Any changes in VAT rates may be reflected in the transport prices.</p>

  <h2>Article 4: Transport Reservation</h2>
  <p>To book a transport offer, the User must select an option matching their criteria on the Site.<br>
  A summary of the booking, including the ticket price, will be sent to the User. After verification, the User must confirm the booking details, having previously accepted these Terms and Conditions of Use.</p>

  <p>All selected information and the reservation validation registered by the Data Controller constitute proof of the transaction; thus, once confirmed, the reservation cannot be modified by the User.</p>

  <p>Users may also create an account on the Site before making a reservation. The account creation section is accessible from the side menu. For future visits, Users must log in with their credentials to book or view their account.</p>

  <p>Users may request the closure of their account at any time via the "Contact" section. The User will be informed by email once the account closure is confirmed.</p>

  <p>In case of difficulties during the booking process, the User can contact the Data Controller either by mail at [8 Place des Alaouites, Av Abou Faris El Marini, Rabat, Morocco], or by phone at [+212 (0) 5 3000 3000].</p>

  <h2>Article 5: Payment and Booking Confirmation</h2>
  <p>The reservation validated by the User will only be final after payment has been made, and will then be confirmed by the Data Controller by email.<br>
  Payment must be made before the sales period closes for the selected trip; otherwise, the reservation cannot be confirmed.</p>

  <p>Users can pay for their ticket as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Payment at authorized partner outlets:</strong> The User can visit authorized outlets with the pre-booking reference to pay in cash. A payment receipt will be issued upon payment.</li>
  </ul>
